  <br> <br>
- Can use global commands for ease of use, has a unified config file, and the ability to change settings in real-time. 
- Contains a feature-rich installer, an uninstaller that cleans up after itself, and logs stored in /var/log/ for statistics.
- Optionally have BatteryControl, PowerControl, FanControl, GPUControl, and SleepControl start on boot if user has rootfs verification disabled.
- Requires Developer Mode - Supports AMD, ARM, and Intel.


<br> <br> 







### __How to Install:__

- Open crosh shell and run: <br>

 `bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowed1/ChromeOS_PowerControl/main/ChromeOS_PowerControl_Downloader.sh?$(date +%s)")`

- The installer will be placed: <br>

  `/home/chronos/ChromeOS_PowerControl/ChromeOS_PowerControl_Installer.sh`

- In *VT-2* or *crosh shell with sudo enabled* run:

 `sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin` <br>
 `sudo mv /home/chronos/ChromeOS_PowerControl_Installer.sh /usr/local/bin` <br>
 `sudo bash /usr/local/bin/ChromeOS_PowerControl_Installer.sh`

- Installer has prompts to customize installation.
- PowerControl, BatteryControl, FanControl, and SleepControl can run in the background and can be adjusted in real-time.

__How It Works:__

<br>

*PowerControl:*

- Uses ARM, AMD, and Intel's max_perf_pct for easy user control.
- Pairs user adjustable max_perf_pct and thermal0 temp sensor to create a user adjustable clockspeed-temperature curve. 
- If $min_temp threshold is below a certain point, the CPU will be able to reach max_perf_pct of its speed.
- The closer the CPU approaches $max_temp, the closer it is to min_perf_pct.
- PowerControl will always be stringent regarding thermals and performance versus native behavior.

<br>

*BatteryControl:*

- Uses ectool's chargecontrol to toggle between normal or idle.
- Check's ectool usbpdpower to identify which charge port is being used
- Recommend turning off adatpive charging in ChromeOS to avoid notification spam.
- Check's BAT0/capacity to measure when to toggle ectool's chargecontrol.
- ChromeOS reports slightly higher values than what BatteryControl sets the charge limit to.
- Charge limit is preserved during sleep unless in deep sleep before reaching limit.

<br>

*FanControl:*

- Uses ectool's fanduty control and autofanctrl for manual and automatic control.
- Pairs fanduty with thermal0 temperature sensor for a user adjustable fan-temperature curve.
- Uses hysteresis formula to attempt a better sounding and performing fan curve than the OEM provides. 
- Uses a kickstart mechanism when fan leaves 0% to enable zero RPM mode for any fan type.
- Default FanControl behavior has aggressive fan ramp-up behavior with a graceful decrease.

<br>

*GPUControl:*

- Identifies the GPU (AMD, Adreno, Mali, and Intel) based on the name of the device's path in /sys/class/
- Limits control to only below the maximum clock speed for safety and with Chromebooks in mind.
- Applies a 120s delay on boot if the user is applying a custom clock speed as a precaution.
- Intel GPU's maximum clock speed changed from: /sys/class/drm/card0/gt_max_freq_mhz
- AMD GPU's maximum clockspeed changed from: /sys/class/drm/card0/pp_od_clk_voltage
- Adreno GPU's maximum clockspeed changed from /sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/max_gpuclk
- Mali GPU's maximum clockspeed changed from: /sys/class/devfreq/mali0/max_freq

<br>


*SleepControl:*

- By reading powerd.LATEST log, SleepControl monitors when the powerd daemon reports 'User activity stopped'.
- Parsing strings like 'User activity started' or 'Audio activity started' tells SleepControl the user is active. to pause until  is reported.
- If 'User activity stopped' and 'Audio activity stopped' is parsed, SleepControl assumes the user is away and custom sleep timers can begin.
- Can turn on or off audio detection to customize sleep during multimedia playback.
- ChromeOS will report 'User activity stopped' after around 20 seconds of inactivity, so the timers won't be exact.
- When idle, SleepControl uses dbus to send an empty input every 120s until interrupted/sleeping with the configurable timer.  
- By using epoch timestamps, SleepControl is able to check when its simulated inputs are to be ignored.
